The classical random walk formalism plays an important role in a wide range of applications. Its quantum 
counterpart, the quantum walk, is proposed as an important theoretical model for quantum computing. By 
exploiting quantum effects such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, quantum walks and their 
variations have been extensively studied for achieving computing power beyond that of classical computing 
and have been broadly used in designing quantum algorithms for algebraic and optimization problems, graph 
and network analysis, and quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process simulations. Moreover, quantum walk 
models have been proven capable of universal quantum computation. Unlike conventional quantum 
circuit models, quantum walks provide a feasible path for implementing application-specific quantum 
computing, particularly in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently, remarkable progress has 
been achieved in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications, which 
demonstrates the great potential of quantum walks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of quantum 
walks and quantum walk computing, including theories and characteristics, physical implementations, and 
applications. We also discuss the challenges facing quantum walk computing, which aims to realize a practical 
quantum computer in the near future.
Introduction
   Quantum computing is a computing model based on quantum 
mechanics, and it utilizes quantum physics effects such as super -
position, interference, and entanglement to achieve computa -
tional power beyond classical computing. With the great potential 
of quantum computing, a large number of tasks that may be 
intractable to classical computers can be solved with exponential 
or polynomial speedup by quantum algorithms. Such tasks range 
from factoring large prime numbers [  1 ] and searching an 
unsorted database [  2 ] to simulating quantum systems and solving 
large systems of linear equations. Toward the ultimate goal of 
building a quantum computer, enormous efforts have been made 
and considerable progress has been achieved. The development 
of quantum computing has passed through the prototype stage 
of demonstrating basic quantum operations and small quantum 
algorithms, and quantum computational advantages have also 
been experimentally demonstrated for certain tasks such as 
boson sampling [  3 ]. While the universal fault-tolerant quantum 
computer remains to be built, quantum computing is now in the 
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and possesses pos -
sibilities for tackling applications of practical interest.
   The category of NISQ computers can include both analog and 
digital quantum devices, depending on the employed quantum 
computing model. There are various quantum computing mod-
els, including the quantum circuit model, quantum Hamiltonian 
evolution model, quantum walk model, quantum annealing 
model, and measurement-based quantum computation model, 
on which quantum algorithms and applications can be designed 
and implemented in quite different ways. These distinct models can hold the capability for universal quantum computing but 
possess different requirements for their physical implementa-
tions. Considering the properties of specific quantum computing 
models and the rapid progress in quantum computing hardware, 
quantum computing for certain applications can be achieved 
more quickly by exploiting appropriate models, particularly in 
the NISQ era.
   Quantum walks (QWs) are the quantum mechanical equiva -
lents of classical random walks. A classical random walk is used 
to describe a particle called a walker that moves stochastically 
around a discrete space, while in a quantum walk, the walker 
is governed by the rules of quantum physics and shows mark-
edly distinct properties compared to its classical counterpart. 
Similar to the classical random walk, which forms the basis for 
designing many classical algorithms such as modeling share 
prices and describing the random movement of molecules, 
quantum walks have become an important model for designing 
quantum algorithms and also provide a promising path for 
implementing quantum computing [  4 –  6 ]. Quantum walks have 
shown beyond classical potential in a variety of problems in the 
fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum 
information processing, and graph-theoretic applications, such 
as database search [  7 ], distinguishing graph isomorphism (GI) 
[  8 –  10 ], network analysis and navigation [  11 ,  12 ], and simulating 
quantum Hamiltonian dynamics [  13 –  15 ]. Meanwhile, it has 
been proven that quantum walks on their own can implement 
universal quantum computing. Quantum walk models also play 
a key role in demonstrating quantum supremacy over classical 
computers, according to which a boson sampling task can be 
viewed as a particular instance of multi-particle quantum walk Citation: Qiang X, Ma S, Song H.

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 2on specific graphs [3], and even for a single-particle quantum 
walk case, it has been shown that sampling quantum walk evo-
lution probability on an exponentially large circulant graph is 
classically intractable [  16 ]. Moreover, quantum walk dynamics 
lead to rich and complicated phenomena to be investigated [  17 ] 
and present the way for exploring various features of different 
particles, such as multi-fermion quantum walk dynamics [  18 ] 
and braiding statistics via anyonic walks [  19 ,  20 ].
   With broad interest in quantum walks and their considerable 
potential, currently, a variety of quantum physical systems are 
used for implementing quantum walks and their applications. 
These physical systems include superconducting systems, trapped-
ion and trapped-atom systems, bulk optics systems, and integrated 
photonics systems. These physical implementation approaches 
are rapidly developing, showing great progress in both the scal-
ability and programmability of quantum walks. For example, 
experimental demonstrations of quantum walks have been real-
ized from simple one-dimensional to high-dimensional cases and 
even complicated structures. The capability of controlling the 
parameters in the quantum walk evolution such as the evolution 
time, underlying Hamiltonian, and evolving particle features is 
continuously increasing in physical quantum walk experiments. 
These considerable advances in physical implementations of 
quantum walks allow various complicated quantum-walk-based 
applications and have laid a solid foundation for implementing 
specialized quantum walk computing systems for applications of 
practical interest.
   Here, we present a comprehensive review of quantum walks 
and quantum-walk-based computing, including quantum walk 
models and theories, their physical implementation, and 
potential applications. The outline of this review is as follows: In 
the “Quantum Walk Theories” section, we introduce various 
quantum walk models, including discrete quantum walks and 
continuous-time quantum walks, and describe the important 
characteristics of quantum walks that are essential for exploring 
quantum walks and designing quantum algorithms beyond the 
classical models, and also compare these quantum walk 
models and discuss their relationships. In the “Quantum Walk 
Implementations” section, we summarize the various physical 
implementations of quantum walk and quantum-walk-based 
applications, together with the latest advancements. We provide 
a comprehensive overview of both the digital physical implemen -
tation of quantum walks (i.e., using quantum circuit models) and 
analog physical implementation of quantum walks including in 
solid-state, bulk optics, and integrated photonics systems. In the 
“Quantum Walk Applications” section, we present the advance-
ments in the algorithms and potential applications based on 
quantum walk models, which comprise quantum computing 
applications, quantum simulation, quantum information process -
ing, and graph-theoretic applications. Finally, in the “Conclusion 
and Outlook” section, we give an outlook on the future of 
quantum walk computing and discuss the challenges.   
Quantum Walk Theories
   In this section, we introduce various proposed quantum walk 
models, compare them, and discuss some essential quantum 
walk characteristics.
   Quantum walks, first proposed as counterparts to classical 
random walks, mainly include discrete-time quantum walks 
(DTQWs) [  21 ,  22 ], which evolve step by step, and the continuous-
time quantum walk (CTQW) [  23 –  25 ], which evolves continuously with time. To address more complex scenarios, additional 
models were created, such as discrete models that can per -
form quantum walk evolution on directed graphs [  26 ], non -
unitary quantum walks [  27 ] for performing evolution in an 
open quantum system, and discontinuous quantum walks 
[  28 ,  29 ], which combine both discrete-time and continuous-time 
quantum walks.
   There are obvious differences between these models, but 
the relationships between them have also gained considerable 
attention in recent studies and are reflected in the transforma-
tion [  30 ] and similar limit distributions of discrete and continu -
ous models [  31 –  33 ], the direct equivalence among different 
discrete models [  34 –  36 ], and the generalization ability of non-
unitary models for describing both quantum and classical ran -
dom walks [ 27 ].
   Quantum walks differ from classical random walks in terms 
of their evolution characteristics [ 23 ,  37 –  41 ] and sampling com -
plexity [ 16 ,  42 –  44 ]. Quantum walks can accelerate the evolution 
process, especially for search algorithms, and have distinctive 
probability distributions leading to particular localization. In 
addition, it is confirmed to be classically hard to simulate the 
sampling of quantum walks such as single-particle quantum 
walks composed of instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits 
and multi-particle quantum walks, one relevant example of 
which is boson sampling.  
Quantum walk models
   Most quantum walk models can be divided into 2 types: the dis-
crete quantum walk models and the CTQW . A discrete quantum 
walk has no time factor and can be realized by several steps, 
whereas a CTQW can be seen as a special quantum simulation 
within time t  using a graph-related time-independent Hamiltonian. 
A third type of quantum walk, the discontinuous quantum walk, 
is composed of discrete steps of continuous quantum walks. It fuses 
the features of the models described above, providing a hybrid 
scheme for universal quantum computation. In addition to these 
unitary models, 2 nonunitary models are also covered here.  
Discrete quantum walk models
   Discrete quantum walk models incorporate a large class of models, 
where coin-based models and coinless models [i.e., Szegedy 
quantum walk (SQW) and staggered quantum walk] can be 
easily distinguished depending on whether there is a coin.
   a. Coin-based quantum walk
   The phrase “discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW)” gener -
ally refers to the coin-based quantum walk, which was first 
proposed as the counterpart of the classical random walk [ 22 ], 
as both of them are realized by 2 procedures: flipping a coin 
and moving in the direction determined by the flipping result. 
However, coin-based quantum walk requires 2 separate spaces 
to accomplish the above processes, namely, coin space C and 
shift space S. In the Hilbert space C ⊗ S, a quantum state 
∣ϕ〉 is defined to describe the probability amplitude of a walker 
arriving at a position, which can be a computational state or a 
superposition state where every computational state represents 
one position in one direction or the coin side. Owing to the 
superposition and entanglement of different positions, this 
model has a different distribution [  45 ,  46 ] and a quadratically 
faster spread [  5 ,  47 ] than the classical model.
   We define 2 unitary transformations, namely, the coin oper -
ator C ⊗ IS  and the conditional shift operator S. It follows that 
the coin-based quantum walk can be described by a unitary

Therefore, the state of the walker will change to Un ∣ ϕ〉 from 
the initial state ∣ϕ〉 after n steps [22].
   The simplest example is the DTQW on a line, on which 
occasion the walker uses 2 coin states, ∣↑〉 and ∣↓〉, to represent 
the 2 directions, left and right; thus, the shift operator can be 
defined by
     
   The choice of coin operator makes a great difference to 
DTQW models. Commonly selected operators include the 
Hadamard coin CH and the Grover coin CG, which are sepa-
rately defined by
     
   The DTQW on a line has interesting quantum effects [  48 ], 
and more about this can be found in [ 48 –  50 ]. Moreover,  Eq. 3  
can also be extended to its N-dimensional version:
    
     
   Generally, coin-based models account for most discrete mod -
els and can be easily defined by the coin operators. For example, 
the Hadamard gate is used as the coin operator for the Hadamard 
walk [ 21 ] and a Grover coin is the coin operator of the Grover 
walk [  51 ]. Table  1  also lists Lackadaisical quantum walk as a 
coin-based model because, although this model adds self-loops on the positions or vertices, it also contains a coin operator and 
a shift operator [  52 ]. 
   In Fig.  1 , we compare the classical and quantum models on 
a 2-dimensional lattice and depict a path on which a walker 
moves from the central point to the endpoint on one diagonal 
of the lattice using numerical simulation. It can be seen that 
the classical walker can only select one path, while the quantum 
walker takes advantage of the coherence of all possible paths. 
In the quantum case, the coin operator is a 4 × 4 large matrix 
of formalism Eq. 4 and the shift operator is analogous to Eq. 2 
but involves the 4 directions: up, down, left, and right.
   b. Szegedy quantum walk
   In 2004, inspired by the discrete-time Markov chain (time-
homogeneous), Szegedy [ 53 ] proposed a quantum version 
with the result of faster search for the marked vertex of a 
graph. Subsequently, this quantum walk model, called the 
SQW , was adopted widely for applications relating to prob-
lems on certain graphs, such as complete graphs [  54 ] and 
directed graphs [16,26].
   Considering a time-homogeneous Markov chain over a 
period of discrete time n , the process can be expressed as 
 pj (n) = ∑ iPij (n)pi (0), where pi (t) is the probability of staying 
at the position i at time t and Pij (t) is the transition probability 
between 2 positions i and j  after time t. Based on this, we can 
define the unitary evolution operator as a one-step coinless 
discrete quantum walk by determining a rule that one walker 
moves on an enlarged symmetric bipartite graph.
   This enlarged graph should have 2 equivalent parts, A and 
 B, both of which consist of all vertices of the original graph. 
If i ∈ A and j  ∈ B, then pij  is the transition probability of 
the walker going from vertex i to vertex j, and the inverse 
process is expressed as qij . The evolution operator is defined 
as follows:
     
   where

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 4   To clearly observe the diffusion effect of this model on the 
single-node state, assuming that the initial state is ∣i0, j0〉, then 
after WA evolution, it is straightforward to obtain that
    
where the first part indicates that the walker moves to another 
position with probability  pi0j0pij   , which is the same as in the 
classical Markov process despite a global factor  pi0j0   . This also 
implies that the SQW is a quantization of the classical random 
walk. Of course, if the superposition state were selected as the 
initialization, interference would arise between different paths, 
which contributes to the fact that this model performs quadrati -
cally faster than classical models in some scenarios [ 26 ,  55 ]. A 
detailed description of the properties of the SQW can be found 
in [ 34 ,   56 ].
   c. Staggered quantum walk
   The staggered quantum walk was fully introduced by Portugal 
et al. [34, 35]. In this model, a graph is split into several tessella-
tions, where any tessellation is composed of polygons, and the 
union of these polygons in one tessellation surrounds all of the 
vertices of the graph. By constructing a reflection operator associ -
ated with one of these tessellations, the walker is restricted to a 
one-step motion in the polygons of one tessellation, so a staggered 
movement, defined by the reflection operators of tessellations in 
several steps, can spread along all the paths in one graph [34]. The 
staggered model can be used for search problems if a separate 
reflection operator related to a partial tessellation with marked 
nodes is interleaved with the model. The properties of the stag-
gered model can be studied by spectral analysis in the same man -
ner as the Szegedy model, and particularly, the 2-tessellate case 
has been discussed in [ 36 ,   57 ]. In addition to using the reflection 
operators directly, considering the reflection operator as a 
Hamiltonian provides an alternative idea for staggered models [ 56 ,  58 ,  59 ] and is more friendly for the physical implementation. 
Recent studies have examined other properties of the staggered 
model, such as the spectral characteristics of the evolution operator 
in the 2-tessellate case [ 57 ] and robustness to decoherence and 
other types of noise [  60 ].   
Continuous-time quantum walk
   The idea of the CTQW also originated from its classical counter -
part, that is, a discrete-time Markov chain (or one-dimensional 
random walk) in a countable state space [ 23 ,  61 ]. According 
to Kolmogorov backward equations,  dPij(t)
dt=∑N
k=1HikPkj(t)    
holds for transition probability Pij (t) and transition rate Hij  to 
describe the jumping process that occurs instead of a diffusion 
process when a state i  changes to the state j . For an undirected 
graph  G of N vertices, we define
    
where γ represents the hopping rate and di  is the degree of 
vertex i, which is a summation of connected edges.
   Let pi (t) be the probability at the position of vertex i  at time t. 
Then, using pi (t) = Pij (t)pj (0) where  ∑N
i=1pi(t)=1     is pre served, 
it follows that
     
   For a quantum particle (or quantum walker) placed on G, 
a superposition state ∣ψ(t)〉 is used to describe its position with 
probability pj (t) = ∣ 〈ψ(t)|j〉|2, where the orthonormal basis (7) 2√pi0,j0∣i0⟩⊗�

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 5{|1〉, |2〉, …, |N〉} corresponds to different vertices of G. Here, 
imaginary unit i is introduced into the left side of Eq. 9 so that 
the equation can be modified to id  ∣ ψ(t)〉/dt  = H ∣ ψ(t)〉. The 
CTQW evolution complying with quantum mechanics is fur -
ther formulated as follows
    
where H = γ(D − A) with degree matrix D  =  diag (d 1, d 2, …, dN ) 
and adjacency matrix A  with entries Ajk  = 1 if vertices j  and 
 k are connected by an edge in G, and Ajk  = 0 otherwise. The 
setting of the Hamiltonian H depends on what it is used for; 
for example, we set H  = A or H  = D − A for GI problems 
and use H  = ∣ ω〉〈ω ∣  − A as a search Hamiltonian when 
searching for a marked vertex expressed as an oracle Hamiltonian 
∣ω〉〈ω∣ [  62 ].
   It is found that the CTQW has computational speedup power 
over classical algorithms in some particular graphs. The first 
example concerns graph traversal problems known as glued-tree 
graphs, where Childs et al. [23] proposed a black-box quantum 
scheme to solve such a problem in polynomial queries, and no 
classical case can provide a solution in subexponential time. 
Other examples such as spatial search have also been proven to 
have a quadratic advantage [  24 , 25 ] using CTQW methods, not 
only for searching for a marked node but also for finding several 
vertices in graphs.   
Discontinuous quantum walk
   The discontinuous quantum walk model, a fusion of the discrete-
time and continuous-time models, exhibits a discrete transition 
from node to node via continuous-time evolution. The first dis-
continuous model was used to devise a scheme for implementing 
any universal gate [29] by way of perfect state transfers (PSTs) 
[28].
   Every step of a discontinuous quantum walk can be consid -
ered as a CTQW , as defined in  Eq. 10 , namely
    
which implements a CTQW from ∣ v1〉 to ∣v2〉. A PST is achieved 
if v1 and v2 represent a pair of vertices in a graph. The discon-
tinuous model makes it much easier to employ a PST between 
nonadjacent vertices by splitting the CTQW of an entire graph 
into several small-scale CTQWs on subgraphs. Subsequently, 
several PSTs on the vertices of well-designed subgraphs can 
perform a universal quantum operation [ 29 ].   
Nonunitary quantum walks
   Unlike the aforementioned unitary models, the following 2 
models are nonunitary and act as open quantum systems. The first 
formalism of the nonunitary quantum walk is a continuous-time 
model, namely, the stochastic quantum walk. This model defines 
a quantum stochastic process described by density operators 
instead of the probability amplitudes of quantum states [ 27 ]. In 
the model, the Lindblad master equation is used as a general type 
of evolution that involves a set of axioms about all possible transi -
tion processes of connected vertices; thus, it can express random 
walks other than the classical Markov process and the CTQW . 
Nevertheless, this model may be difficult to realize experimen-
tally in near-term quantum devices; therefore, an approach to 
circumvent this limitation has been proposed in [  63 ]. Owing to 
its advantages in describing evolution in open systems, including 
both decoherence and coherence process, this model has been 
applied in multiple applications, such as analyzing the transport process in photosynthesis [  64 ], PageRank [  65 ], and function 
approximation, data classification, and others [  66 ].
   Analogously, there is also a type of discrete model for open 
quantum systems, namely, the open quantum walk model [67], 
which is derived directly from the formalism of the operator-sum 
representation. This model sparked discussions about quantum 
Markov processes [  68 –  71 ] and studies on some of its properties 
such as limit distribution [  72 ,  73 ] and hitting time [  74 ].    
Quantum walk model comparisons
   There are clear differences and relationships between the dif-
ferent random walks. Here, we present a detailed analysis of 
the difference and relationship between the original discrete-
time and continuous-time quantum walk, the interchangeability 
of various discrete quantum walk models, including the coin-
based quantum walk, SQW , and staggered quantum walk, and 
how nonunitary models unify the classical random walk and 
parts of quantum walk models.
   The study of quantum walk models has progressed rapidly in 
recent years; however, the 2 original branches, the discrete-time 
and continuous-time quantum walk models, still matter in this 
field. No doubt there exists the obvious difference that the coin-
based discrete model (DTQW) has an extra space, whereas the 
continuous-time model does not. Some other interesting differ -
ences must be considered. First, a DTQW requires different num -
bers of quantum states when performing a quantum walk on a 
graph. For an arbitrary graph, a DTQW introduces a quantum 
state for each edge of every vertex, whereas a CTQW only intro-
duces a quantum state for each vertex. Second, it is feasible for a 
DTQW to regulate the coin of each step while the CTQW has to 
control evolution by modifying the Hamiltonian. Therefore, in 
the design of algorithms, an appropriate model should be selected 
according to the specific situation.
   Despite the considerable distinctions listed above, deter -
mining the underlying relationship between these 2 models is 
a fundamental problem. It has been shown that they have simi -
lar spreading properties, such as faster diffusion than classical 
models [ 23 , 51 ], and the long-time limit of the DTQW with a 
certain coin operator is approximately equivalent to the 
CTQW case in terms of the probability density [ 31 – 33 ,  75 ]. 
Moreover, in various applications, both the DTQW and CTQW 
algorithms work, maintaining the same performance for many 
algorithms, such as search [ 7 ,  76 ] and GI [ 8 ,  77 ], both of which 
can be used for universal computation [  78 ,  79 ]. Owing to these 
similarities, some studies are more concerned about how to 
convert between them. For example, Strauch [  80 ] first inves-
tigated how coin-based or coinless discrete quantum walk 
models can be transformed into the CTQWs by taking the 
limit of certain parameters and blazed a path for those seeking 
to generalize such a transformation to higher-dimensional 
walks. More specific results can be seen in [30], where Childs 
presented a procedure for constructing an SQW to simulate 
the CTQW with any Hamiltonian. There is a similar theory in 
which the Hamiltonian of the CTQW can be discretized by 
the commuting adjacency matrices under the partition of a 
graph, where the evolution based on one adjacency matrix 
constitutes one step of the staggered model with Hamiltonians, 
which is applied to numerous graphs, such as the Cayley graph, 
as stated in [59]. These results demonstrate that the 2 models 
are interchangeable to some extent, but note that this inter -
changeability only means a strict approximation rather than a 
direct equivalence.(10) ∣/u1D713(t)⟩=e−iHt∣/u1D713(0)⟩,

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 6   However, direct interchangeability exists among various 
discrete models, and their relationships are shown in Fig.  2 . 
Among discrete quantum walks, any Szegedy walk is equivalent 
to a 2-tessellable staggered quantum walk on the line graph of 
one bipartite graph [ 34 ], and both can be converted to coin-
based quantum walk models on multigraphs satisfying the 
regularity and other conditions listed in [  81 ]. Conversely, a 
coin-based quantum walk can be regarded as the SQW on a 
bipartite graph if the degree of vertices on one side is 2, or 
staggered quantum walk on the line graph if the tesselation 
covers the perfect matching, as in [81] and [35], respectively. 
More generally, any coin-based model using the flip-flop shift 
operator can be cast into a Szegedy model or a staggered model 
only if the coin operator is an orthogonal reflection despite 
the graph being nonregular [ 81 ]; a special example is Grover 
search, which can be seen as 2 steps of the Grover walk [51], a 
type of coined-based quantum walk with the Grover coin. Not 
considering strict conditions for graphs or models, a family of 
discrete walks regarding 2 local operators, called partition-
based quantum walks [36], are unitary equivalent; that is, the 
evolution operators of any Szegedy model, the 2-tessellate stag -
gered model, and the 2-step coined model are interchangeable 
except for a unitary multiplier [ 36 ,  82 ].        
   Note that 2 models for describing walks in an open environ -
ment can cover both classical and quantum models. One is the 
open quantum random walk, which is a new model but also 
embodies existing well-known models using unitary operators, 
such as the Hadamard walk. With the addition of measure-
ments after each step, the open quantum random walk can be 
changed into a classical model, such as a homogeneous discrete 
Markov chain if using well-designed Kraus operators, or a non -
homogeneous case if using general Kraus operators. For the 
continuous-time case, the stochastic quantum walk introduces 
an axiomatic formalism by means of a master equation and can not only recover a classical random walk (such as a continuous-
time Markov chain) or a CTQW but also enlarge the region of 
continuous-time random walk models, as shown in Fig.  2 .   
Quantum walk characteristics
   Quantum mechanic effects cause quantum walks to behave 
differently from classical random walks in certain properties, 
such as mixing time and hitting time, and allow quantum walks 
to handle complex problems, such as quantum sampling prob -
lems, which are difficult for classical simulation. Thus, in this 
section, 2 main classes of characteristics, evolution and sam-
pling, are discussed.  
Evolution characteristics
   Here, we introduce some characteristics available during the evo -
lution process of a quantum walk that have a close connection 
with the evolution time or probability distribution of states and 
are useful for demonstrating the merits of quantum models com -
pared with classical random walks. As is shown in Fig.  1 , quantum 
walk reveals a faster propagation and different localization com-
pared with one of the famous classical random walk models.
   • Mixing time
   Mixing time is defined as a quantity for describing the short -
est time when the probabilities P (x, t), for different vertices 
where the walker stays after time t, get sufficiently close to a 
stationary distribution π (x). If we define the time-averaged 
distribution by  P(x,T)≡1
T∑T
t=1P(x,t)   , then the stationary 
distribution is  /u1D70B(x)=limT→∞P(x,T)   . So, for a certain small 
constant ϵ > 0, the mixing time [ 24 ,  83 ] is

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 7   Note that the mixing time for the continuous-time walk [ 24 ] 
shares the same definition as Eq. 12 after replacing P(X,t) with 
P(X,t)=1
T/uni222B.upT
0P(X,t)dt.
   • Hitting time
   Hitting time is used to evaluate the time from a starting 
vertex to a marked vertex when detecting or searching for a 
target on a graph and is a vital quantity for comparing the 
performance of different random walks even when the exact 
time complexity is unknown. There are various ways to define 
hitting time. Generally, classical hitting time is the expected 
time [  84 ] (i.e., first hitting time) at the first reaching of the end 
vertex, which is directly defined by
    
where Pij(t) is the probability that the walker travels from vertex 
 i to vertex j after time t. Analogously, the continuous version 
of  Eq. 13  is  limT→∞ /uni222B.upT
0tPij(t)dt   .
   For quantum walks, we care more about the time when the 
probability of hitting the target is greater than a threshold 
 ϵ, and it has been discovered that quantum walks propagate 
exponentially faster than classical random walks on some 
graphs [ 23 , 37 ]. Thus, the hitting time can also be defined by
    
where  P�
ij(t)    is the probability of finding the marked vertex j  
from starting vertex i after time t. Another definition refers to 
an optimal hitting, i.e., the time related to the maximal arriving 
probability, which was shown to be exponentially faster than 
that of the classical model [  38 ,  85 ].
   In contrast to these notions, quantum hitting time for an SQW 
aims to quantify the running time of searching for a marked ver -
tex on the complete graph. Using this metric, a quadratic speedup 
compared to the classical algorithms was proven [ 84 ,  86 ].
   • Commute time
   The term “commute time” means the expected time needed 
for the walker to travel from the starting vertex to the end vertex 
and back again. Accordingly, the commute time from vertex 
 i to j is defined as
    
from which it is found that Tij
C=Tji
C, so the commute time is a 
symmetric quantity.
   For a CTQW , commute time can be directly computed using 
the Laplacian spectrum and can help to analyze the graph-
embedding property and distinguish clusters in a set of graphs [  39 ].
   • Cover time
   The cover time [  87 ] for the graph G, denoted as Cover(x, G) 
if the starting vertex is x, is the expected time to traverse every 
vertex. If the starting vertex is not assigned, then the cover time 
for an undirected graph is expressed as
     
   This term reflects the search efficiency of a region of a graph 
rather than that of some specific vertex, which is the key feature 
that differentiates it from hitting time [  88 ].
   • Anderson localization   Anderson localization is a phenomenon of the absence of 
diffusion in disordered circumstances due to the interference 
of waves from various paths. A tight-binding model of this 
phenomenon [  89 ] was first proposed by Anderson to describe 
the wave function (i.e., a time-independent probability ampli-
tude) of one particle on an impure lattice. Taking the example 
of an electron trapped in a potential field, this phenomenon also 
provides a credible explanation for the metal-insulator transition 
[  40 ] because the electron would be localized at a neighbor of 
the starting position, leading to a loss of the conductivity prop -
erties of the system, if we were to set the energy at each lattice 
site in a random way [  90 ,  91 ].
   Anderson location is also an important characteristic for 
quantum walk models [  92 ], where the analogous propagation 
impediment will arise with increases in the randomization 
condition, such as setting the phase-shift operator for each step 
[  93 ] or randomly removing lattice sites [  94 ]. As one of the most 
popular propagation models, the quantum walk also has been 
selected to experimentally demonstrate Anderson localization 
in various systems [ 93 –  96 ]. In contrast to the direct observa-
tion of distribution on all sites, in these experiments, more 
detailed qualification plays a vital part in examining the degree 
of the localization. For example, the average distance and num -
ber of particles on initial sites are of interest in recent related 
experimental studies [ 93 ,  95 ].   
Quantum dynamics and sampling complexity
   In addition to their merits of evolution compared with the clas -
sical random models, quantum walks also promise quantum 
supremacy in terms of computing power in various scenarios, 
particularly for sampling problems, which have been shown to 
be classically intractable to simulate for both single- and multi-
particle cases [16,42].
   Here, we first introduce the multi-particle quantum walk, 
and as it is an enhanced version of the single-particle model, we 
set forth its capability for more complex tasks, such as simula-
tion on a larger graph using relatively few resources by harness -
ing multi-particle properties. Subsequently, quantum sampling 
problems are briefly elaborated, and 2 examples of the single-
particle quantum walk on the circulant graph and boson sam-
pling are presented to demonstrate computational advantages 
beyond classical algorithms.
   • Quantum dynamics of multiple particles
   In contrast to distinguishable classical particles, micro-
scopic particles at the quantum scale, like elementary parti-
cles, atoms, and molecules, are indistinguishable in principle. 
Indistinguishable quantum particles—whether bosons, fermi-
ons, or anyons—exhibit distinct behaviors in quantum statistics 
[  97 ]. In a multi-particle system, bosons demonstrate symmetric 
exchange, fermion antisymmetric, while anyons, unique to 
2-dimensional systems, display fractional statistics with interme -
diate exchange properties. So, the fact is straightforward:
    
where a creation (annihilation) operator  a†
i/parenleft.s1ai/parenright.s1    represents an 
increase (or decrease) of particle number on mode i, and ζ is 
set to 1, −1 or any fraction for bosons, fermions, or anyons, 
respectively.(13) Tij

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 8   Consider any M-particle quantum walk model in Fock space, 
which is denoted by a unitary U  without loss of generality. Its 
initial state can be characterized by creation or annihilation 
operators, and is given by
    
where ∣0〉 is the vacuum state and ∣M〉 =  ∣ m 1, m 2, ⋯〉 is the 
Fock state in occupation number representation and M  = ∑ imi . 
Specially, for m  particles with a single mode,  Eq. 18  can be 
converted to ( a †) m  ∣ 0〉.
   Then, after time t of evolution, the final state becomes
     
   Note that most problems are related to the detecting of the 
probability P  M → T  of any output state ∣T〉 =  ∣ t 1, t 2, ⋯〉 with 
initial state ∣M〉; thus, we formulate it as
    
where SM  is the symmetric group defined over all permutations 
of M elements, U  T, M  is constructed from the original unitary 
U by repeating the ith row ti times and the jth column mj times, 
and the function inv(⋅) represents the inversion number of one 
permutation.
   From the fact that the dimension of Fock space grows expo-
nentially with particle number, it becomes feasible that quantum 
walks on exponentially large graphs are performed using the same 
time as the one-particle case on a small graph [ 16 ,  98 –  100 ]. To 
see this, consider a multi-particle CTQW on the N -dimensional 
Hilbert space. Its simulation scale for the one-particle CTQW 
will be enlarged to NM dimensions if M  particles begin walking 
simultaneously, which is seen from the corresponding noninter -
acting Hamiltonian H (M) that is expressed as a direct sum of 
 M one-particle Hamiltonians H :
    
It can be directly concluded that the multi-particle model 
can simulate the Cartesian product of graphs, which is a 
kind of NM -dimensional graph, if all particles are distin-
guishable [ 62 ].
   As for identical particles, the exchange symmetry between 
them results in a spatial dimension lower than the distinguish -
able case but notably higher than the one-particle case. Here 
are 2 examples involving bosons and fermions, both of which 
require a symmetrization operator  /uni0302.s1P    to map the Hamiltonian 
from Fock space to Hilbert space. We define the basis state 
∣Φ〉 = ∣ k 1〉 ⊗  ∣ k 2 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗  ∣ kM 〉 on Hilbert space     ⊗M , and 
the symmetrization operator is described as
    
in which B  and F  represent bosons (ζ  = 1) and fermions (ζ  =  − 1), 
respectively, and  U/uni0302.s1/u1D70E    is the permutation matrix associated with  /uni0302.s1/u1D70E   . For fermions, if no 2 particles occupy the same vertex so that 
 k 1 < k 2 < ⋯ < kM , then there are  /parenleft.s3N
2/parenright.s3
    basis states, which means 
a reduction to the one-particle CTQW on  /parenleft.s3N
2/parenright.s3
   -dimensional 
graph. Analogously for bosons, if  k 1 ≤ k 2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ kM , then it is 
concluded that the CTQW using multiple bosons can simulate 
a larger graph with  /parenleft.s3N+1
2/parenright.s3
    vertices [ 62 ,  99 ].
   • The supremacy of quantum walks in sampling problems
   A sampling problem is a type of problem that collects sam-
ples from a given probability distribution and acts as a solid 
foundation for numerous disciplines. Quantum sampling prob-
lems refer to the ones being solved by sampling (or measuring) 
outputs of quantum circuits, some of which are difficult to 
simulate using any classical algorithm; thus, they promise a 
demonstration of quantum supremacy in near-term quantum 
devices [ 3 ,  43 , 44 ,  101 ]. Sampling quantum walk evolution is 
similarly difficult for classical algorithms, but it could be achiev -
able in a quantum way. Here are 2 examples.
   As an important class of quantum walk models, one-particle 
CTQWs can be efficiently performed on graphs in the circulant 
class, whereas the classical simulation algorithms cannot 
[ 16 ], when the initial state is ∣0〉 and a projective measurement 
is applied under the basis ∣0〉〈0∣. This process can be described 
by the following probability formulation:
    
This equation is easily seen to hold since the adjacency matrix 
 Hc  of any circulant graph can be factorized as a quantum 
Fourier transformation F and a diagonal matrix D′ such that 
 D = e −itD ′ is also a diagonal matrix. From this, a connection has 
been established between the CTQW and the instantaneous 
quantum polynomial circuits [  102 ], which were confirmed to 
be classically hard to sample [43].
   The same polynomial hierarchy collapse occurs in multi-
particle quantum walks, as can be seen from the fact that the 
quantum walks of multiple bosons are equivalent to boson 
sampling problems in the sense of the behaviors of quantum 
particles. A vital step toward the classical sampling of one quan -
tum circuit is computing probability PM → T  using Eq. 20. If we 
consider that all particles are bosons, it directly follows that
    
where Perm (⋅) represents the permanent of any matrix and 
computing it is theoretically a #P-hard problem. Therefore, 
there does not exist any polynomial-time classical algorithm 
to simulate boson sampling [  103 ].
   Note that both of these 2 cases still hold under the condition 
that the classical simulation or quantum computer is noisy and 
imperfect, as has been confirmed based on the unproven worst-
case or average-case hardness conjectures [ 3 , 103 ].

resonance (NMR) [  110 ,  111 ], trapped atoms [  112 ], laser beam 
and bulk optics [  113 –  127 ], and integrated photonics systems 
[ 38 , 62 , 85 , 93 , 100 ,  128 –  135 ]. Different quantum walk models, 
such as discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walks 
and quantum-walk-based algorithms and applications, have 
been experimentally demonstrated.
   There are 2 different approaches to physically implementing 
quantum walks: analog physical simulation of quantum walks 
and digital physical simulation of quantum walks. In the analog 
physical simulations of quantum walks, the apparatus is dedi-
cated to implementing specific instances of the Hamiltonian 
without translation into quantum logic, and most of the existing 
experimental demonstrations are of this kind. The analog physi -
cal simulation of quantum walks is not limited to graph struc-
tures, although for single-particle quantum walks it does not 
scale efficiently in terms of resources when simulating broad 
classes of large graphs. As the number of evolving particles 
increases, the simulated multi-particle quantum walks become 
classically intractable because of the exponentially large Hilbert 
space. The analog approach can scale by increasing the number 
of particles and the dimension of the Hamiltonian evolution; 
on the other hand, few existing methods exist for realizing error 
correction or providing fault tolerance in implementing analog 
physical simulations of quantum walks.
   In digital physical simulations of quantum walks, it is neces -
sary to construct quantum circuits for implementing quantum 
walk evolution. If an efficient quantum circuit can be con-
structed, quantum speedup can be achieved for implementing 
quantum walks. With such quantum circuit implementations 
of quantum walks, one can either implement additional quan-
tum circuit operations or perform direct measurements of the 
output evolution states [ 16 ]. In general, it is difficult to design 
efficient quantum circuits for simulating quantum walks, 
although many such circuits have been found in families of 
graphs for different quantum walk models. However, with the 
digital simulation of quantum walks (i.e., quantum circuit 
implementations), fault tolerance and error correction in simu -
lating quantum walks would be available by using the existing 
technologies in general quantum circuit computing.
   We summarize in Table  2  different kinds of physical imple-
mentations of quantum walks, including both digital and ana-
log physical implementation approaches, and compare these 
approaches in terms of quantum walk models, encoding meth -
ods, programmability, and scalability. Different physical imple -
mentations of quantum walks and the recent progress are 
further described in detail in the following sections.   
Digital physical implementation of quantum walks
   Quantum walk simulations in general can be implemented on 
a digital quantum computer, but only efficient quantum circuits 
promise quantum speedup compared to classical computation. 
Consider that if a quantum circuit that uses O(log( N)) qubits 
and O(log(N )) elementary gates can implement quantum walks 
on a graph of N vertices, the quantum circuit is then efficient. 
Efficient quantum circuit implementations for quantum walks 
on various kinds of graphs have been studied, as shown in 
Fig.  3 . For DTQW models, efficient quantum circuits have been 
proposed for some highly symmetric graphs, including cycle, 
hypercycle, complete graphs, and “twisted” toroidal lattice 
graphs [ 136 ,  137 ]. For non-degree-regular graphs, such as star 
graphs and Cayley trees with an arbitrary number of layers, quantum circuits for simulating DTQW on these graphs 
have also been proposed, and a quantum-walk-based search 
algorithm on these graphs was shown to be implemented using 
these circuits [138]. Loke and Wang [54] presented a general 
scheme to construct efficient quantum circuits for SQWs that 
correspond to classical Markov chains possessing transforma-
tional symmetry in the columns of the transition matrix. They 
further applied this scheme to construct efficient quantum 
circuits simulating the Szegedy walks used in the quantum 
PageRank algorithm for some classes of nontrivial graphs, pro -
viding a necessary tool for experimental demonstration of the 
quantum PageRank algorithm. This quantum circuit imple-
mentation of the SQW has been demonstrated on a program-
mable silicon photonic quantum processor [  139 ].        
   For the CTQW model, an efficient quantum circuit imple-
mentation has been demonstrated for several classes of graphs, 
including commuting graphs and Cartesian products of graphs 
[140]. There are few classes of graphs for which the CTQWs 
can be fast-forwarded to obtain an efficient quantum circuit 
implementation. It has been pointed out that glued trees, com -
plete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and star graphs can be 
simulated efficiently using the diagonalization approach [30]. 
A certain class of circulant graphs have also been identified as 
efficiently implementable [16]. Circulant graphs can be diago -
nalized using the quantum Fourier transform, and by using 
the quantum Fourier transform circuit and inverse quantum 
Fourier transform circuit, a whole efficient quantum circuit for 
a CTQW on the circulant graph can be constructed if the given 
circulant graph of 2n vertices has O (poly( n)) nonzero eigenval -
ues, or has more distinct eigenvalues but can be characterized 
efficiently (such as the cycle graphs and Möbius ladder graphs) 
[16]. It is noteworthy that efficient quantum circuits for CTQWs 
on circulant graphs enable the simulation of circulant molecu-
lar dynamics (for example, the DNA Möbius strips) via quan-
tum walks. Moreover, it has been proven from computational 
complexity theory that sampling the output probability distri-
bution of even single-particle quantum walks on exponentially 
large circulant graphs could be classically intractable and thus 
demonstrates quantum supremacy over classical computers—
this shows a new link between CTQWs and computational 
complexity theory. An experimental demonstration has been 
realized using a bulk optics quantum processor setup [ 16 ]. Also, 
in NMR systems, both the CTQW and DTQW using qubit 
models have been demonstrated [ 110 , 111 ]: the CTQW on a 
circle with 4 vertices has been experimentally demonstrated 
using a 2-qubit NMR quantum processor [ 110 ], and the DTQW 
on a square was experimentally demonstrated using a 3-qubit 
liquid state NMR quantum processor [ 111 ]. Among the 3 qubits, 
1 qubit describes the coin state and 2 qubits describe the 
position state.
   The digital physical simulation approach of quantum walks 
(i.e., quantum circuit implementation) can have the following 
benefits. First, quantum walks are used as a tool for designing 
quantum algorithms. Quantum circuit implementation can be 
used to efficiently implement quantum walk oracles, and fur -
ther to implement the quantum walk algorithms. Second, quan -
tum circuit implementation can provide a better estimate of 
the complexity and resources needed to implement quantum 
walk on a given graph than a “black-box” oracle. Third, to realize 
quantum-walk-based algorithms on a universal quantum com -
puter, an efficient quantum circuit would be needed to imple -
ment the required quantum walk evolution.

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 12Analog physical implementation of quantum walks
   The analog physical implementation of quantum walks has been 
demonstrated using different physical systems and has also 
shown great potential for accelerating useful NISQ quantum 
computing systems. Recently, experimental and technical 
advancements have been achieved in various physical systems 
for simulating quantum walks. Through the analog physical 
implementation approaches of quantum walks, a quantum-
walk-based application-oriented quantum computing system 
is being pursued, which aims to implement different quantum walk simulations and quantum-walk-based applications. It 
is usually required that the quantum walk system has full 
programmability for quantum walk evolution. Such program-
mability can include (a) Hamiltonian programmability, which 
requires configuring the corresponding Hamiltonians of quan -
tum walks for different instances of the problem; (b) evolution 
time programmability, which requires controlling the evolution 
time of quantum walks; (c) initial state programmability, which 
requires configuring the initial state of quantum walks, e.g., 
uniform superposition state or single basis state; and (d) particle

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 13feature programmability, given that particle distinguishability, 
particle exchange symmetry, and particle interactions can affect 
the output results of multi-particle quantum walks. The current 
analog implementation approaches to quantum walks, includ-
ing solid-state, bulk optics, and integrated photonics systems, 
have shown the capability of these programmable abilities for 
various quantum walk simulations and quantum-walk-based 
applications.  
Quantum walks in solid-state quantum systems
   Quantum walks have been demonstrated using solid-state 
quantum systems (Fig.  4 A to F), such as NMR systems, super -
conducting systems, trapped-ion systems, and trapped-atom 
systems. In NMR systems, the demonstrations of quantum 
walks mainly used qubit models (i.e., they used a digital 
physical implementation approach [ 110 , 111 ]), while the other 
systems use analog physical implementation approaches as 
described below.
   In superconducting quantum systems, superconducting 
qubits can be used as artificial atoms with high-fidelity manipu -
lation and tomographic readout, allowing them to easily simu -
late interacting quantum walks and explore even the hard-core 
boson interference in quantum walk evolution. In a circuit of 
quantum electrodynamic architecture, where a superconduct-
ing transmon qubit is coupled to a high-quality-factor electro-
magnetic cavity, considering that the quantum walk takes place 
in the phase space of the cavity mode, one can realize a quantum 
walk on a circular lattice in the cavity phase space. Ramasesh et  al. 
[104] demonstrated that such a simulation platform associated 
with DTQWs is naturally suited to the direct extraction of topo -
logical invariants. Quantum walks of 1 and 2 strongly correlated 
microwave photons have afterward been demonstrated in a 
one-dimensional array of 12 superconducting qubits in the 
presence of strong attractive interactions [105]. Furthermore, 
with a 62-qubit superconducting processor, the easy program-
mability of the circuit enables the realization of fully configurable 
2-dimensional quantum walks [106]. Experimental demonstra-
tions show the realization of programmable quantum walks, 
enabling the definition of propagation paths for quantum 
walkers, with the remarkable control of not only the qubit 
frequencies but also the tunneling amplitude and phase between 
neighboring sites.
   In trapped-ion systems, DTQWs have been demonstrated, 
where the simulated walker evolves along a line in a phase space 
[ 107 – 109 ]. By extending the quantum walks using 2 ions, the 
walker achieves the additional possibility of staying instead of 
taking a step [  108 ]—the coin operation has 3 options: move 
left, move right, or stay. To increase the number of steps of a 
DTQW using a trapped-ion system, it is necessary to take into 
account the high-order terms of the quantum evolution. A 
novel protocol for quantum walks has been proposed based on 
a scheme from the field of quantum information processing 
using photon kicks [  141 ,  142 ] to overcome these restrictions 
and allow, in principle, hundreds of steps. This protocal can be 
extended to quantum walks in higher dimensions [109].
   In trapped-atom systems, a DTQW of up to 24 steps on a 
line with single neutral atoms has been demonstrated, by deter -
ministically delocalizing the atoms over the sites of a one-
dimensional spin-dependent optical lattice [ 112 ]. To achieve 
many steps, atomic systems require formidable control and 
isolation from their environment, which is a challenge that must 
be overcome.   Quantum walks in optics systems
   Optics or photon systems are currently well-developed for 
implementing quantum walks, among the analog implementa -
tion approaches of quantum walks. Using various methods of 
encoding degrees of freedom (DOFs), such as spatial modes 
(or path), polarization, time-bin, orbital angular momentum 
(OAM), and frequency, different photonic platforms have been 
used for implementing quantum walks (Fig.  4 G to N). These 
photon platforms include bulk optics systems, fiber systems, 
and integrated photonics systems, as described in the next sub -
section, showing extensive techniques and promising progress 
in the photonic implementations of quantum walks.
   In bulk optics systems, several different methods have been 
used for implementing DTQWs. With laser pulses as the simu -
lated walkers, by encoding coin states in the polarizations of 
photons and encoding position states in the time-bin of pho-
tons, Barkhofen et al. [ 113 ] and Lorz et al. [  114 ] successively 
demonstrated both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional DTQWs 
with controllable coin operations. To overcome the extra loss 
in a conventional loop structure, Xu et al. [ 115 ] introduced 
birefringent crystals to implement the conditional shift opera-
tions in DTQWs, and with the polarization-encoded coin 
space and the time-bin-encoded position space. Alternatively, 
Xue et al. [ 116 – 120 ] used photon polarization for the coin state 
and the spatial mode for the position state, where the wave 
plates were used for coin operations and beam displacers (BDs) 
were used for conditional shift operations; thus, a variety of 
DTQWs and DTQW-based application experiments have been 
demonstrated.
   Using the DOFs of photons, spin angular momentum (SAM) 
and OAM, a qubit system and a high-dimensional system can 
be encoded and realized, respectively, which provides a feasible 
method for implementing DTQWs. By encoding the coin state 
space in SAM and the position state space in OAM, Zhang et  al. 
[121] used a spin-orbital system to implement a one-dimensional 
DTQW . Goyal et al. [122] alternatively used OAM modes as 
lattice sites and polarizations as the coin state to implement a 
DTQW with a laser beam, in a proposed ring interferometer. 
Giordani et al. [123] further used a similar linear optics platform 
for a DTQW with the OAM of photons to investigate quantum 
walk dynamics, demonstrating a quantum state-engineering 
toolbox via quantum walks. In their experiments, they used 
the OAM of light as the physical embodiment of the walker, 
while the logical states of the coin were encoded in circular 
polarization states.
   Fiber systems are also used for implementing quantum walks, 
considering that bulk optical systems can have larger sizes and 
challenging scalability and stability. Fiber systems can easily use 
fiber loops to implement time-bin-encoded quantum states. 
Recently, some types of specialized fibers have allowed new 
methods of encoding quantum walks. In 2010, by encoding 
the coin states in the polarizations of photons and the position 
state in the time zone, Schreiber et al. [ 125 ] used a fiber-loop 
setup to implement a DTQW in 5 steps on a line with adjustable 
coin operations. With customized multicore ring fibers, 
Nguyen et al. [ 126 ] demonstrated CTQWs and localized 
CTQWs in a new optical fiber that has a ring of cores constructed 
using both periodic and quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequences. In 
this case, each core represents a site of CTQW and photons can 
be transmitted between different cores during the CTQW evolu -
tion. Furthermore, Defienne et al. [ 127 ] used a multimode fiber 
(MMF) to implement a quantum walk of indistinguishable

wavefront shaping methods was used, which establishes MMFs

Quantum walks in integrated photonics systems
   Integrated quantum photonics is an engineering solution pro-
posed for the robust and fine control of photonic quantum 
information by allowing the generation, manipulation, and 
detection of photons on a single chip. It enables the miniatur -
ization of quantum photonic experiments into chip-scale wave -
guide circuits, and thus provides an ideal platform for realizing 
devices with high subwavelength stability for generalized quan -
tum interference experiments such as multi-photon quantum 
walks. By employing photons as quantum walkers on intrinsi-
cally stable integrated waveguide arrays that are used as quan -
tum walk evolution networks, integrated photonics devices 
have been extensively used for implementing multi-particle 
quantum walks on large networks with even more complicated 
structures (Fig.  5 A to F). In some integrated photonics devices, 
each waveguide is generally coupled to several other wave-
guides, enabling the fabrication of structures that are directly 
mapped to graphs with a high degree of connectivity with 
different coupling strengths for nearest and non-nearest neigh -
boring waveguides. In this way, it is equivalent to the adjacency 
matrix of the graph that represents the waveguide structure on 
which the CTQW evolves. In addition, a reconfigurable on-chip 
optical network, consisting of Mach–Zehnder interferometers 
(MZIs) and phase shifters, can be programmed into an arbitrary 
optical unitary transformation [  143 ] and is thus used for 
implementing the quantum walk evolution with different 
Hamiltonians by reconfiguring the on-chip network easily 
(Fig.  5 G and H).
   In 2010, Peruzzo et al. [ 128 ] first demonstrated a one-
dimensional CTQW in an array of 21 continuously evanescently 
coupled waveguides in a SiOxNy (silicon oxynitride) chip, 
and they simulated one-particle walking on a 2-dimensional 
lattice by injecting 2 indistinguishable photons into the 
chip. With the technology of direct laser waveguide writing, 
waveguide chips have been fabricated for 1-dimensional to 
2-dimensional quantum walks and for quantum walks with 
complicated structures. In 2014, Poulios et al. [  129 ] demon-
strated the quantum walks on an integrated photonic wave-
guide chip with a 2-dimensional “Swiss cross” structure and 
implemented quantum walks on a more complex graph struc -
ture of 45 vertices and 126 links by performing quantum 
walks of 2 indistinguishable photons in the “Swiss cross” 
waveguides. In 2021, Benedetti et al. [  130 ] demonstrated the 
CTQW evolution in a planar triangular lattice structure wave -
guide chip on a fused-silica substrate fabricated using the 
femtosecond-laser writing technique and implemented a 
CTQW-based spatial search on 2-dimensional triangular 
graphs. With a maze of tens of waveguide modes fabricated 
by femtosecond-laser waveguide writing, Crespi et al. [  131 ] dem -
onstrated that a quantum walker traveling in a maze can 
achieve extremely efficient and fast transmission.
   Both the scalability and complexity of the waveguide struc-
ture fabricated by femtosecond-laser writing techniques have 
achieved rapid developments in recent years, and different 
quantum walk evolution dynamics have been demonstrated. 
With a 2-dimensional structure of waveguides up to 160 modes, Jin et al. [ 85 ] experimentally demonstrated quantum fast 
hitting on hexagonal graphs, achieving a linear relationship 
between the optimal hitting time of CTQW and the network 
depth. By using a waveguide chip containing nearly 700 sites, 
they further implemented CTQWs in fractal photonic lattices 
and experimentally investigated quantum transport in fractal 
networks, which further revealed the transport process through 
either the direct observation of photon evolution patterns or 
the quantitative characterization [  132 ]. By using femtosecond-
laser direct writing techniques, various large-scale structures 
that form a 2-dimensional lattice with up to 37 × 37 and 49 × 49 
sites have been implemented on photonic chips [  133 , 134 ]. These 
chips can be used to simulate much larger graph structures by 
using an injected 2-photon state; for example, using a chip of 
37 × 37 sites, Jiao et al. [133] simulated a single-photon CTQW 
in a higher dimensional graph structure that contains 1,369 sites 
and 6,600 edges.        
   Although the femtosecond-laser writing technique is mostly 
used for fabricating waveguide chips for implementing CTQWs, 
it also provides a good platform for implementing DTQWs. With 
a disordered lattice realized by an integrated array of interfer -
ometers fabricated in glass by femtosecond-laser writing, Crespi 
et al. [93] experimentally implemented the DTQW with 8 steps 
and observed the Anderson localization of entangled photons 
in a DTQW affected by position-dependent disorder. With a 
femtosecond-laser-written waveguide chip, Sansoni et al. [100] 
implemented an array of beam splitters for a 4-step quantum 
walk and experimentally demonstrated how particle statistics, 
either bosonic or fermionic, influence a 2-particle DTQW .
   Silicon quantum photonics, taking advantage of its high com -
ponent density, full programmability, and CMOS (complemen -
tary metal oxide semiconductor) compatibility, has become a 
very promising approach for implementing large-scale photonic 
quantum computing [ 62 , 139 ,  144 –  146 ] and universal quantum 
computing [  147 ]. With well-developed on-chip photonic quan -
tum state generation and manipulation, silicon quantum pho-
tonics also presents an ideal platform for implementing quantum 
walk simulations and quantum-walk-based algorithms. Silicon 
photonics can implement on-chip reconfigurable linear optical 
networks consisting of MZIs and phase shifters that are universal 
for arbitrary unitary operations. With such reconfigurable 
on-chip networks, quantum walk evolution on arbitrary graph 
structures can be implemented, and with multiple photons 
injected into the network, multi-photon quantum walks can be 
performed. In addition, with control over entangled photons 
and reconfigurable optical networks on chip, the full pro-
grammability over quantum walks, such as Hamiltonian pro-
grammability, evolution time programmability, initial state 
programmability, and particle feature programmability, has been 
studied [ 100 ,  148 ] and experimentally demonstrated in silicon 
quantum photonics [38,62,135].
   In 2021, Qiang et  al. [ 62 ] first implemented a universal multi-
particle quantum walk processor in silicon quantum photonics 
by exploiting an entanglement-driven scheme, and they realized 
quantum walks with full control over various parameters in one 
device, including the evolution time, initial state, underly-
ing graph structures, particle exchange symmetry, and particle 
indistinguishability. The device can implement 2-photon quan-
tum walks on any 5-vertex graph with continuously tunable 
particle exchange symmetry and indistinguishability. Using the 
device, they showed how this simulates single-particle walks on 
larger graphs, with the size and geometry controlled by tuning

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 17the properties of the composite quantum walks. Employing such 
full programmability, different quantum-walk-based algorithms 
were experimentally demonstrated using the device, such as 
searching for vertices in graphs and testing for GI. The increasing 
integration scale of silicon quantum photonics enables a larger 
scale of quantum walk simulations. Using the same protocol for 
universal multi-particle quantum walk simulation, Wang et al. 
[38] further implemented larger-scale quantum walks using a 
fully programmable large-scale silicon photonic quantum walk 
processor, which enabled the simulation of quantum walk 
dynamics on graphs with up to 400 vertices. With this system, 
they demonstrated the exponentially faster hitting and quadrati -
cally faster mixing performance of quantum walks over classical 
random walks, achieving more than 2 orders of magnitude 
of enhancement in the experimental hitting efficiency and 
a reduction of almost half in the experimental evolution 
time for mixing. They implemented numerous large-scale 
quantum-walk-based applications, including measuring the 
vertex centrality and searching for marked vertices in networks 
of up to hundreds of nodes. Moreover, such full programmability 
over quantum walks by using silicon quantum photonics pro-
vides methods for simulating other physics via the dynamic 
behavior of quantum walk evolution; for example, the topologi -
cal phase of higher-order topological insulators can be simulated 
in the same quantum walk processor [ 38 ], and by implementing 
a time-reversal symmetry-breaking quantum walk on a recon-
figurable silicon photonic device, the enhancement introduced 
by breaking time-reversal symmetry was experimentally 
demonstrated [ 135 ].     
Quantum Walk Applications
   Along with the excellent development of quantum walk theo-
ries and rapid progress of quantum walk implementation tech -
niques, the exploration of quantum walk applications has 
flourished. We divide quantum walk applications into 4 main 
categories: quantum computing, quantum simulation, quan-
tum information processing, and graph-theoretic applications, 
as shown in Fig. 6. These 4 categories represent the different 
aspects of exploiting the potential of quantum walks. First, as 
the quantum counterpart of the well-known classical random 
walk, quantum walks are naturally assumed to be capable of 
designing quantum-walk-based algorithms that may outper -
form their classical counterparts in a broad class of applica-
tions. Considering their capability for universal quantum 
computation, quantum walk models provide a sufficient pos-
sibility for designing quantum algorithms. Second, quantum 
walk evolution describes the physical process of quantum particle 
evolution and presents a method for solving quantum simu -
lation applications via quantum walks. Quantum walk on 
its own provides a framework for studying multi-particle 
properties, for example, bosonic, fermionic, and anyonic particle 
characteristics; moreover, it can act as a general approach 
for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics and in applications of 
molecular analysis and biochemical processes. Third, quantum 
walks can serve as a comprehensive toolbox in the field of 
quantum information processing for the preparation, manipu -
lation, characterization, and transmission of quantum states, 
and this paves the way for the development of new techniques 
for quantum information processing applications, for example, 
applications based on quantum walks, novel protocols for 
quantum communications, and new algorithms for quantum cryptography have been proposed. Finally, because the under -
lying Hamiltonian that determines the evolution of quantum 
walks is directly associated with the structure of a graph, quan -
tum walks are a promising tool for solving graph-theoretic 
applications such as exploring the structure of a graph more 
efficiently or distinguishing between graph structures more 
precisely. Thus, a variety of network applications can be 
addressed using quantum walks by mapping them to related 
graph-theoretic problems.          
Quantum computing
   A critical part of quantum computation is to design appropriate 
quantum algorithms for different problems, which is quite a 
challenging task. In the commonly used quantum circuit model, 
a quantum circuit acts on a fixed number of qubits and terminates 
with a measurement. Similarly, quantum walk models provide a 
new approach to designing quantum computing algorithms 
(Fig.  7 A and B): a particular quantum walk evolution with an 
input initial state is performed, and the probability distribution 
of the output evolution state is usually sampled to extract 
results. Quantum walk models are a versatile tool in quantum 
computation; they are proven to be universal for quantum com -
putation, and thus, any other quantum algorithms in theory 
can be implemented via quantum walks; furthermore, quantum 
walks are the quantum counterparts of the well-known classical 
random walks, and thus, they open up a new avenue for design -
ing quantum walk algorithms that can outperform classical 
random walk algorithms.
   Quantum walks have been shown to be capable of perform -
ing universal quantum computation. The power of the quantum 
walk as a universal model of quantum computation was first 
explored by Childs [78] in 2009, when he demonstrated that a 
CTQW can be used for universal computation in the sense that 
any quantum computation can be simulated by a quantum walk 
on a sparse, unweighted graph of low degree. Subsequently, 
Childs et al. considered multi-particle quantum walks with 
interactions and showed that any n-qubit circuit with g gates 
can be simulated by the dynamics of O (n) particles that interact 
for time poly(n, g) on a weighted planar graph of maximum 
degree 4 with poly(n, g) vertices, which means that a multi-
particle quantum walk is capable of performing efficient uni-
versal quantum computation [6]. In 2010, Lovett et al. showed 
that a DTQW is also capable of universal quantum computa-
tion, and thus can be regarded as a computational primitive 
similar to a CTQW [79]. Underwood and Feder [29] extended 
this concept to discontinuous quantum walk, in which a quan-
tum walker takes discrete steps of CTQW evolution, and showed 
that it is also a universal model of quantum computation. These 
studies have collectively shown that quantum walk models are 
capable of universal quantum computation, which may inspire 
a new architecture of a quantum computer that does not require 
complex control and also provide tools for designing quantum 
algorithms and analyzing quantum computation theory. To 
explore the full power of universal quantum-walk-based com-
putation, recent studies on error correction in quantum walk 
evolution may be important in this field [  149 ,  150 ]. For example, 
based on the 2-lattice Bose–Hubbard model, a quantum walk 
error correction algorithm can reduce the decoding time of the 
error correction process and achieve a high fault-tolerance rate 
[150]. In addition, some error mitigation strategies are useful 
for reducing the impact of noise on particles during quantum 
walks [  151 ,  152 ].

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 18   Quantum walks have been widely used in designing quan-
tum algorithms that can achieve computational speedup over 
classical algorithms for various problems, particularly algebraic 
and number-theoretic problems. Typically, for black-box prob -
lems, quantum walk algorithms can achieve exponential speed -
ups. A well-known example is the glued-tree problem [ 23 ]: a 
glued tree is a graph obtained by taking 2 binary trees of equal 
height and connecting each leaf of one tree to exactly 2 leaves 
of the other tree such that the degree of each node that was a 
leaf in one of the original trees is now exactly 3. It has been 
shown that the time taken by a CTQW on this glued tree to reach the right root from the left one is exponentially faster than 
the classical random walk [ 23 ], and a proof-of-principle experi-
mental demonstration was also presented [  153 ]. Another example 
is a quantum algorithm for finding hidden nonlinear structures 
over finite fields [  154 ]. The algorithm is based on a quantum walk 
on a graph that encodes the structure of the black-box function. 
An exponential speedup arises from the quantum interference 
effect, which allows the quantum walker to explore the search space 
more efficiently than classical algorithms.
   For some algebraic problems, quantum walks have the potential 
to achieve a polynomial computational speedup over classical

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 19algorithms, leading to faster and more efficient solutions. For 
example, Ambainis [  155 ] presented an optimal quantum 
algorithm for the element distinctness problem, where for deter -
mining whether all elements of a list of size N  are distinct, 
only Θ(N 2/3) queries are required using a quantum walk algorithm, 
whereas classically Ω(N) queries are required. In the problem 
of formula evaluation, a formula is encoded into a tree with a 
gate at each internal node and an input bit at each leaf node, 
and the task is to evaluate the output of the root node when 
given oracle access to the input. With a quantum-walk-based 
algorithm, the formula evaluation problem can be solved using 
many fewer queries, achieving a polynomial speedup compared 
to classical algorithms [  156 ]. In addition, quantum walks have 
been applied to other problems in algebraic theory and number 
theory, such as checking matrix multiplication [  157 ], testing 
group commutativity [  158 ], subset sum [  159 ], and triangle 
finding [  160 ]. These quantum walk algebraic algorithms 
have important implications for applications in various fields, 
including cryptography, data analysis, drug discovery, and opti -
mization, and can serve as the basis for designing other quan-
tum computing algorithms or protocols.
   Quantum walk models have also been investigated in the 
fields of machine learning and optimization and show promise 
for the design of quantum neural networks with new structures 
and algorithms. For example, Dernbach et al. proposed a quan-
tum walk neural network [  161 ], where the neural network archi -
tecture learns a quantum walk on a graph by learning the coin 
operator and then uses this learned quantum walk to form a 
diffusion operator to act on the input data. They obtained com-
petitive results compared to other graph neural network 
approaches. Schuld et al. studied the use of quantum walks as 
an approach to quantum neural networks, using the formalism 
of quantum walks to determine the dynamic evolution of a quan -
tum neural network that optimizes the computational properties 
of classical neural networks [  162 ]. Quantum walks have also 
been explored to enhance classical neural networks, for example, 
during the training of a classical artificial neural network, where 
a quantum walk algorithm is applied to search for weights [  163 ]. 
For addressing usually NP-hard optimization problems, a quan -
tum walk optimization algorithm was developed by Marsh and 
Wang [  164 ,  165 ]. It utilizes an efficient indexing algorithm in 
conjunction with a generalization of the quantum approximate 
optimization algorithm mixing operator to a CTQW over a cir -
culant graph that connects all feasible solutions. The algorithm 
was applied to the NP-hard problem of portfolio optimization 
with discrete asset constraints to find high-quality solutions to 
the portfolio optimization problem [  166 ] and demonstrated the 
applicability of the quantum walk optimization algorithm to the 
capacitated vehicle routing problem [  167 ], where the algorithm 
achieved the expected qualities with less computational effort 
than is required by classical random sampling. Other optimiza-
tion algorithms based on quantum walks have also been pro-
posed, such as a clustering algorithm based on one-dimensional 
quantum random walks that were applied in network cluster 
server traffic control and task scheduling [  168 ] and the quantum 
backtracking algorithm proposed by Montanaro [  169 ], which 
consists of solving a constraint satisfaction problem by construct-
ing a backtracking tree and exploring it using a quantum walk.   
Quantum simulation
   Quantum simulation uses a controllable quantum system to 
simulate the behavior of other quantum systems. It aims to gain insight into complex quantum phenomena that are difficult or 
impossible to analyze using classical computers. This is a rapidly 
growing field, ranging from molecules and materials to quan-
tum field theories. Quantum walks can be used as tools for 
quantum simulation (Fig.  7 C to F) and have potential applica-
tions in simulating multi-particle systems, solving complex 
physical problems, and understanding biochemical processes. 
By using quantum walks to simulate these systems, one can 
gain in-depth knowledge of their properties and behavior.
   Quantum walk evolution provides a path for exploring multi-
particle quantum dynamics and various characteristics. The 
applications of multi-particle quantum walks depend on various 
factors, including the number, exchange symmetry, and indis-
tinguishability of the particles involved, and the underlying 
graph structures in which they move. Furthermore, entangled 
photons can be used to simulate multi-particle quantum walks 
with bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic statistics using an entangle -
ment-based scheme. This method was first used in [100,148], 
where both a CTQW and DTQW of 2 particles were experimen -
tally demonstrated. Specifically, Sansoni et al. [ 100 ] demon-
strated the implementation of a 2-particle bosonic-fermionic 
quantum walk using integrated photonics. Matthews et al. dem -
onstrated the simulation of fermionic statistics with photons in 
one-dimensional CTQW evolution [ 148 ]. These experiments 
show that differences in particle exchange symmetry can affect 
the quantum walk dynamics owing to the Pauli exclusion prin-
ciple (Fermi–Dirac statistics) or Bose–Einstein statistics. 
Using an extended entanglement-based protocol, Qiang et al. 
[ 62 ] demonstrated the CTQW evolution of multiple particles 
with both tunable particle exchange symmetry and indistin-
guishability by adding control over the entangled photons. In 
2022, Wang et al. [ 38 ] realized a large-scale fully programmable 
quantum walk and demonstrated the use of this platform to 
simulate the behavior of multi-particle systems and explore 
topological phases in quantum systems using quantum walks, 
including higher-order topological insulators. In addition, a 
larger quantum walk can be used to simulate the behavior of 
multi-particle quantum walks on a smaller graph to investigate 
multiple-particle dynamics. In 2012, Schreiber et al. [  170 ] dem -
onstrated the use of a 2-dimensional quantum walk on a larger 
graph to simulate the dynamics of 2 interacting particles on a 
one-dimensional graph.        
   A quantum walk can act as a general approach for simulating 
quantum Hamiltonian dynamics and investigating their various 
properties. Berry et al. proposed algorithms for simulating non -
sparse Hamiltonians with nearly optimal dependence on all 
parameters by implementing a combination of quantum walk 
steps with fractional-query simulation [  171 ]. They also proposed 
an algorithm for simulating Hamiltonians using a black-box 
approach [ 15 ], where the Hamiltonian is treated as an oracle. 
These algorithms aim to improve the efficiency of Hamiltonian 
simulation, particularly for nonsparse Hamiltonians. Berry and 
Novo [  172 ] proposed a method to simulate Hamiltonian evolu-
tion by repeatedly using a superposition of the steps of a quan-
tum walk and then applying a correction to the weightings for 
the number of steps of the quantum walk. In conventional quan -
tum mechanics, the Hamiltonian describing a quantum system 
must be Hermitian, and the corresponding evolution is a uni-
tary process. However, in practice, physical quantum systems 
are typically open, which means that they interact with their 
environments and exchange energy and information with 
them, resulting in non-Hermitian systems. One approach to

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 20simulating non-Hermitian systems using quantum walks is to 
introduce a complex potential into the walk [ 173 –  175 ], which 
breaks the symmetry of the system and allows for the simulation 
of non-Hermitian behavior. Another approach is to implement 
a nonunitary quantum walk [  176 ,  177 ], which allows the simula -
tion of non-Hermitian systems without requiring the introduc-
tion of a complex potential. Parity-time (PT) symmetric systems are a special type of non-Hermitian systems in which the 
eigenenergies of the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian 
are entirely real. In 2017, Xiao et al. [  119 ] proposed a quantum 
walk model suitable for PT-symmetric systems and experimen -
tally realized PT-symmetric DTQWs with single photons. 
Quantum walks can also be used to explore quantum thermo-
dynamic behavior. Romanelli et al. [  178 ,  179 ] investigated the

it to N-dimensional systems. They also explored the relation-
ships between quantum walks, entanglement, and the laws of 
thermodynamics, demonstrating that entanglement plays a key 
role in the thermodynamic behavior of quantum walk models 
[  180 ]. Wang et al. [  181 ] experimentally verified the generalized 
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and generalized thermal -
ization in a photonic DTQW .
   Topological phases exhibit unique properties that challenge 
our understanding of phases and phase transitions. Instead of 
being characterized by local order parameters, these phases are 
defined by nonlocal topological invariants that determine the 
existence and number of topological edge states at the interface 
between the bulk and boundary regions through what is known 
as the bulk-boundary correspondence. Quantum walks provide 
new insight into the simulation and study of topological phe-
nomena in quantum dynamics, including the exploration of 
topological phase transitions [ 116 ], the measurement of topo-
logical invariants [ 117 ], and the simulation of topological phases 
and edge states [ 119 ]. For example, Kitagawa et  al. [  182 ] observed 
topologically protected bound states in photonic quantum walks; 
Asbóth [  183 ] explored the role of symmetries in one-dimensional 
quantum walks; and Panahiyan and Fritzsche [  184 ,  185 ] simulated 
multiphase configurations, phase transitions, and edge states 
with quantum walks using a step-dependent coin. Quantum 
walks can also be used to simulate the topological phases in non -
unitary systems. Mittal et al. [ 176 ] investigated the persistence 
of topological phases in non-Hermitian quantum walks. They 
extended the one-dimensional split-step quantum walk model 
to a nonunitary quantum walk and demonstrated the persistence 
of topological phases. In addition, nonunitary Floquet opera-
tors have been used to explore the topological properties of non-
Hermitian systems. By imposing PT symmetry, Xiao et al. [ 119 ] 
realized and investigated Floquet topological phases driven 
by PT-symmetric quantum walks. Xu et al. [  186 ] explored the 
dynamic topology hidden in a periodically driven system using 
a quantum walk. They experimentally classified quenched 
quantum walks using the dynamic Chern number, which pro-
vides an intrinsic method for classifying quenched quantum 
walks. They also demonstrated the relationship between the 
dynamic Chern number and quasi-equilibrium topological bulk 
invariants associated with quenched quantum walks between 
different topological phases. In addition, they experimentally 
observed that split-step quantum walks can be characterized 
using a dynamic topological order parameter and measured this 
parameter in quantum walks [  187 ].
   Quantum walks are also used to simulate and understand 
complex biochemical processes such as photosynthetic energy 
transfer, the behavior of biological molecules such as proteins 
and DNA, and chemical reactions. Mohseni et al. [14] used a 
quantum walk to simulate the energy-transfer process in a pho -
tosynthetic system. Quantum walks can enhance the efficiency 
of energy transfer and conversion [  188 ], which is crucial for 
energy harvesting and utilization in biological systems. Hoyer et  al. 
[  189 ] showed that there is a limit to the quantum speedup in 
these processes. Quantum walks can also be used to simulate 
the protein–DNA target search and DNA sequence assembly 
process [  190 ,  191 ], and it has been shown that they can improve 
the efficiency and accuracy of this search and assembly. Varsamis 
and Karafyllidis proposed a quantum-walk-assisted algorithm 
for peptide and protein folding prediction [ 191 ], which is impor -
tant for understanding protein function and drug design. The essence of chemical reactions is the process of interactions 
between molecules, and quantum walks have been used to 
simulate these interactions to obtain a better understanding 
of the mechanisms and properties of chemical reactions. Chia et  al. 
[  192 ,  193 ] explored the use of quantum walks in coherent 
chemical kinetics, developed reaction operators for radical 
pairs, and found that quantum walks can be used to model and 
predict the behavior of radical pairs in this system. Overall, the 
use of quantum walks for biochemical simulations can lead to 
new insights and possible breakthroughs in fields such as drug 
discovery and bioengineering.   
Other quantum information tasks
   Quantum walks have been extensively studied in the field of 
quantum information processing and have been used as tool-
boxes for the preparation, manipulation, characterization, 
and transmission of quantum states (quantum information). 
Various quantum-walk-based protocols for quantum commu -
nication and routing have been developed. A key advantage of 
using quantum walks in quantum information processing is 
their ability to encode and process quantum information in a 
highly controlled and tunable manner. Quantum walks have 
thus been explored in various tasks of quantum information 
processing (Fig.  8 A to D), including entanglement generation 
[  194 –  196 ], PST, quantum state measurement [  197 ,  198 ], quan -
tum teleportation [  199 ], quantum communication [  200 ,  201 ], 
and quantum cryptography [  202 ].
   Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum infor -
mation processing. Quantum walks have been shown to be a 
powerful tool for generating and manipulating quantum entangle -
ment. By controlling the evolution of quantum walks, the neces-
sary entanglement can be generated. In 2013, Vieira et al. 
[  195 ] proposed a dynamically disordered quantum walk 
designed to maximize the entanglement between 2 particles by 
introducing randomness into the evolution of the quantum walk. 
Their quantum walk can generate more entanglement than other 
types of quantum walks, and the entanglement it generates can 
be controlled by adjusting its parameters. Gratsea et al. [  203 ] pro -
posed a scheme for preparing hybrid maximally entangled states 
of 2 qubits by controlling the evolution of a quantum walk on a 
one-dimensional lattice, which involved encoding the target state 
into the initial state of the walk and controlling the walk evolution 
using a sequence of unitary operations. Using a DTQW , arbitrary 
superposition states for 2 qubits can be prepared [ 194 ]. Panda 
et al. [  204 –  206 ] proposed various methods for applying DTQWs 
on graphs to generate entangled states. They designed a graph 
structure and quantum walk dynamics to maximize the entangle -
ment between the quantum walker and internal DOFs. These 
methods have considerable potential for application in quantum 
information processing. In addition, quantum walks have been 
used to control the degree of entanglement between particles and 
generate entangled states with specific properties, such as maxi-
mal entanglement [195,196]. Furthermore, quantum walks can 
be used to study the properties of entangled states and to test the 
principles of quantum mechanics. For example, Rohde et al. 
[  207 ] studied the entanglement dynamics of DTQWs and showed 
that the entanglement between the walker and environment 
can exhibit quasiperiodic behavior. Melnikov and Fedichkin 
studied the entanglement properties of the quantum walks of 
interacting fermions on a cyclic graph [ 18 ]. Quantum entangle-
ment also arises between the coin and position in DTQWs [  208 –
  210 ], and recent experimental research shows that disorders can

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 22enhance the entangling ability of quantum walks [  211 ]. This char -
acteristic can be considered an indicator of the topological phases 
in quantum walks, according to [  212 ].
   The ability to determine the quantum state of a system accu -
rately is crucial for many applications in quantum information 
processing. Quantum walks have great potential and advan-
tages for the characterization and measurement of quantum 
states. First, quantum walks can be used to realize generalized 
and nonlocal quantum state measurements. In 2013, Kurzynski 
and Wojcik proposed that quantum walks can be viewed as 
generalized measurement devices [  213 ] and demonstrated that 
a one-dimensional DTQW can be used to implement a general -
ized measurement in terms of a positive operator value measure 
(POVM) on a single qubit. Bian et al. [ 197 ] and Zhao et al. 
[ 198 ] used one-dimensional photonic quantum walks to 
realize POVM measurements of a single qubit. In addition, 
quantum walks can be used to achieve efficient quantum 
state reconstruction and tomography. Titchener et al. [  214 ] 
used 2-photon Thomson scattering and quantum walks to 
implement the tomography of 2-photon states. They employed 
a hybrid quantum walk within on-chip coupled waveguide 
arrays as the measurement process and successfully recon-
structed the input 2-photon density matrix. Hou et al. [  215 ] 
achieved deterministic collective measurements using pho-
tonic quantum walks. They used a collective symmetric 
informationally complete POVM realized through a pho-
tonic quantum walk to perform qubit state tomography with 
unprecedented accuracy.        
   Quantum walks have also been explored as tools for quantum 
state transmission and for applications in quantum communica-
tion including quantum networks, quantum teleportation, and 
quantum key distribution. It is possible to transmit quantum 
states over long distances by encoding information regarding 
the state of the quantum walker. Targeting quantum com-
munication applications, Y ang et al. [ 200 ] and Chen et al. [ 201 ] 
proposed a novel DTQW approach for quantum network com -
munication and presented a quantum multi-unicast communi -
cation scheme and a PST scheme over a butterfly network and 
an inverted crown network, respectively. Shang et al. [  216 ] pro -
posed quantum communication protocols based on quantum 
walks with 2 coins, where information is encoded in the coin 
state and transferred to any target position using 2 coin opera-
tors. Srikara and Chandrashekar [  217 ] developed 2 quantum 
direct communication protocols, namely, a quantum secure 
direct communication protocol and a controlled quantum dia-
logue protocol, using DTQWs on a cycle graph. Panda et al. 
[  218 ] proposed a new quantum direct communication protocol 
that utilizes the entanglement generated during the evolution 
of k-cycle DTQWs. In quantum teleportation applications, 
Wang et al. [ 219 ] proposed a generalized quantum teleportation 
protocol based on quantum walks with 2 coins, where an 
unknown qubit state can be teleported using quantum walks on 
a line and on a cycle with 4 vertices. This protocol can transmit 
any unknown d -dimensional state without the prior entangled 
state, making it more flexible than existing d -dimensional state 
teleportation protocols. In addition to single-qubit teleportation, 
quantum walks can also realize multiqubit teleportation. Li et al. 
[ 199 ] proposed a multi-particle quantum-walk-based teleporta -
tion scheme where the entanglement between walkers and their 
respective coins is generated by step operators in multi-particle 
quantum walks. This protocol allows for the flexible selection 
of the transmission path and enables more efficient transmission of quantum states. Moreover, quantum walks can also be 
used to implement a quantum key distribution protocol. 
Vlachou et  al. [  220 ] proposed a quantum key distribution 
scheme based on quantum walks that includes verification pro -
cedures against full man-in-the-middle attacks and provides 
provable unconditional security.
   In the domain of quantum cryptography and security appli -
cations, quantum walks have been extensively explored for 
designing novel secure schemes and for attacking various cryp -
tographic schemes. For example, quantum walks have been 
used in quantum image encryption [ 202 ,  221 –  223 ], steganog-
raphy [  224 –  226 ], generating high-quality random numbers 
[ 227 ,  228 ], quantum cryptanalysis [  229 ], and attacking lattice-
based cryptography [  230 ]. Color images can be encrypted using 
controlled 1-particle quantum walks [ 202 ], 2-particle quantum 
walks [ 223 ], 2-dimensional quantum walks, and quantum cod -
ing. Quantum walks can also be used in combination with Gray 
code and Henon maps for cloud-based image encryption 
[  231 ]. Quantum walks have also been applied in steganography 
[ 224 – 226 ] to achieve high security and can be used for cloud-
based image steganography and e-healthcare platforms. Several 
studies [  232 –  234 ] have proposed quantum-walk-based security 
protocols that can be used to protect data and information in 
various scenarios such as 5G networks and Internet of Things 
(IoT)-based smart cities. Quantum walks can also be used to 
attack cryptographic schemes. Kaplan et al. [ 229 ] proposed 
a quantum-walk-based differential and linear cryptanalysis 
method that can be used to break some traditional symmetric 
cryptography algorithms. Lattice-based cryptography is a leading 
candidate for postquantum cryptography. The shortest vector 
problem is crucial for the cryptanalysis of lattice-based cryp-
tography. Chailloux and Loyer proposed a heuristic algorithm 
based on quantum walks to solve this problem, which con-
siderably improved the running time of the algorithm [ 230 ]. 
Another common problem in cryptanalysis is collision finding, 
which has been extensively studied using both classical and 
quantum algorithms. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm 
in finding multiple collision pairs, Bonnetain et al. [  235 ] intro -
duced a chained quantum walk algorithm that considerably 
reduced the complexity of the algorithm.   
Graph-theoretic applications
   The underlying Hamiltonian that determines the evolution of 
quantum walks is directly associated with the structure of a graph, 
where, for example, in the CTQW each vertex of the graph 
encodes a quantum basis state, and each edge represents a pos-
sible transition between 2 quantum basis states. Quantum walks 
are thus a promising tool not only for graph-theoretic problems 
but also for various network applications, which they can map to 
related graph-theoretic problems (Fig.  8 E to I). Quantum walks 
possess distinct characteristics on a graph compared with classical 
random walks and enable efficient graph structure explorations 
such as searching for marked vertices and ranking vertex impor -
tance. Quantum walks are particularly effective in identifying the 
structural differences between graphs and have been intensively 
studied for graph-comparison applications. Furthermore, various 
network applications have been studied by mapping onto graph-
theoretic problems and addressed using quantum walks. Here, 
we summarize recent advancements in quantum walks used in 
graph-theoretic and network applications.
   Compared to classical random walks, quantum walks are 
more efficient at exploring graph characteristics because they

Qiang et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/icomputing.0097 24perform quantum walk evolution on a graph. It has been shown 
that it is possible to achieve faster hitting and mixing times 
than with classical random walks [  236 –  238 ]. This enables more 
accurate estimation of the spectrum and characterization of 
related properties such as connectivity and expansion proper -
ties. The spectrum of a graph generally indicates the essential 
features and properties of the graph, such as its diameter, degree 
distribution, and clustering coefficient [  239 ]. Based on this, 
quantum-walk-based algorithms for searching for marked ver -
tices, ranking vertex centrality, and other structural exploration 
tasks have outperformed their classical counterparts in different 
aspects. In 2003, Childs and Goldstone [ 7 ] first proposed a 
CTQW-based algorithm for spatial search problems (i.e., 
problems related to searching for marked vertices in graphs) 
and showed that quantum walks can achieve a quadratic 
speedup over classical algorithms for searching for a marked 
vertex on an unweighted graph of N vertices, where the com-
plexity of the quantum walk algorithm is  O(√
N)   , but that of 
the classical algorithms is O(N). It has been proven that a spatial 
search using a quantum walk algorithm is optimal for almost all 
graphs [  240 ]. Several other studies have investigated CTQWs 
used in spatial search problems [ 24 , 25 , 241 –  244 ]. Janmark et al. 
[  242 ] demonstrated that global symmetry is not necessary for 
fast quantum search using CTQWs. They proposed a new algo-
rithm that achieves the same speedup as the standard Grover 
search algorithm using a nonsymmetric Hamiltonian. Wong 
[  243 ] proposed a variant of Grover search using lackadaisical 
CTQWs that allows the quantum walker to rest occasionally 
during the search, thereby reducing resource requirements. 
Chakraborty et  al. [  245 ] discussed the optimality of spatial search 
via a CTQW and provided the necessary and sufficient conditions 
for optimal quantum search. Furthermore, quantum-walk-based 
algorithms have been used to search for marked vertices in 
weighted graphs [  246 –  248 ] and dynamic graphs [  249 –  251 ], and 
marked edges in graphs [  252 ]. In addition to CTQW models, 
discrete quantum walk models, including the Szegedy walk, stag-
gered quantum walk, and coin-based quantum walk, have also 
been shown to solve spatial search problems [ 26 , 34 , 35 ,  253 ]. 
Quantum-walk-based search is attractive because it is expected 
to have useful properties (e.g., robustness to noise and ease of 
physical implementation) [ 251 ], and various experimental dem -
onstrations have been presented. For example, using a bulk 
optics quantum system [ 124 ], Qu et  al. experimentally demon -
strated deterministic search on star graphs via quantum walks. 
Using a programmable silicon photonic chip, Qiang et al. 
[ 62 ] implemented a quantum-walk-based search on various 
graphs for both single and multiple marked vertices. They 
experimentally demonstrated, on a large-scale fully program-
mable quantum walk system, a quantum-walk-based search on 
graphs with 10 to 210 vertices [ 38 ].
   In addition to searching for marked vertices, quantum walks 
show great potential for ranking vertex centrality. Vertex cen-
trality is an integral tool in graph theory and network analysis 
and can be used to quantify the importance of each vertex. A 
higher vertex centrality measure indicates more importance. 
The vertex centrality measure has been widely used in ranking 
webpages on the Internet, for example, in the well-known 
PageRank algorithm, and in other applications such as identify -
ing critical infrastructure nodes in social and urban networks. 
The PageRank algorithm was first proposed by Paparo et al. 
[  254 ,  255 ] based on SQW models. It is more sensitive than classical algorithms: it can highlight secondary hubs and resolve 
the degeneracy of low-lying nodes in the network [ 255 ]. An 
alternative quantum centrality measure using a CTQW model 
was also proposed [ 256 ]. It requires a smaller Hilbert space than 
Szegedy-quantum-walk-based algorithms. The CTQW-based 
vertex centrality ranking algorithm was extended to centrality 
measures for directed networks [  257 ] and weighted graphs 
[  258 ]. Experimental demonstrations of these algorithms include 
ranking vertices on directed graphs using bulk optics quantum 
systems [  259 ,  260 ] and testing quantum centrality ranking for 
scale-free networks of 55 vertices using a fully programmable 
silicon quantum photonic processor [ 38 ]. The experimental 
results achieved high fidelities with theoretical predictions.
   Quantum walks have also demonstrated their effectiveness 
in identifying structural differences between graphs and are 
used for several types of graph-comparison problems, such as 
distinguishing nonisomorphic graph pairs, measuring similar -
ity between graphs, and solving graph classification. The GI 
problem is the problem of determining whether 2 graphs have 
the same structure. It is thought to be neither an NP-complete 
nor a polynomial-time problem, and the best proven general 
algorithm is quasi-polynomial-time [  261 ]. Several quantum-
walk-based GI algorithms have been proposed, demonstrat-
ing the potential of quantum walk for solving GI problems 
[ 8 – 10 , 62 , 99 ,  262 –  268 ]. These algorithms differ in terms of the 
type of quantum walk model that is used (i.e., discrete-time 
or continuous-time), number of particles involved, presence 
of particle interactions, localized inhomogeneities, and 
methods of constructing graph certificates. The single-particle 
CTQW model achieved an improved distinguishing ability for 
strongly regular graphs (SRGs) with 64 vertices by adding 
phases to the edges [ 62 ], while both interacting and noninter -
acting multi-particle CTQWs, especially for 2 bosons with 
interaction [  9 ] and 4 fermions with noninteraction [ 99 ], can 
also distinguish nonisomorphic SRGs on the same scale. Strong 
distinguishability also appears in the single-particle discrete 
model. For example, as the level of the search-based signature 
increases, the isomorphism algorithm can obtain a stronger 
distinguishing ability, even for SRGs with up to 64 vertices [268]. 
It is noteworthy that although none of the proposed quantum-
walk-based GI algorithms have been proven analytically to be 
able to distinguish all graphs in polynomial time, their capability 
of distinguishing nonisomorphic graphs has been tested by 
numerous numerical simulations on wide classes of graphs. 
Moreover, some of the algorithms, such as the CTQW-based GI 
algorithm, have been extensively experimentally demonstrated 
on fully programmable silicon photonic quantum walk proces-
sors [38,62], where the sizes of the experimentally tested graphs 
are up to 210 vertices [38]. Based on the distinguishability of 
nonisomorphic graphs, quantum walks can provide an effective 
measure of the similarity between graphs. There are 2 ways to 
use quantum walks to measure graph similarity: one is to use a 
similar method for calculating the fidelity between graph certifi -
cates that are directly constructed through the output probability 
distribution of the evolved states, and the other is to use the 
complete quantum state to compute graph kernels [  269 ]. 
Quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence and related methods 
[  270 ,  271 ] show strong separation ability and have become 
popular methods for computing graph kernels and have been 
applied to both DTQW [ 269 ] and CTQW [  272 ] models. 
Furthermore, computing the similarity matrix of a graph set 
as a key procedure can be directly used in classical classification

problems [269,271].
   Based on studies on graph-theoretic quantum walk algo-
rithms, quantum walk algorithms can be used in various fields 
for additional practical applications, such as network routing 
[ 239 ], social network analysis [  273 ], community detection [ 274 ], 
and information propagation modeling [  275 ]. In general, these 
applications can be modeled as graph-theoretic problems, and 
quantum walk algorithms can be used to find optimal solutions 
with speedup over classical algorithms or to explore complex 
dynamics and in-depth structural analysis via quantum walk 
dynamics. In the domain of network routing, a network can be 
modeled as a graph, where the vertices in the graph represent 
network routers or switches and edges represent the physical 
links connecting these devices. In a study by Zhan et al. [239], 
the scheme for realizing quantum routing was based on a con-
trollable PST via DTQWs. In the field of social networks, by 
modeling users as vertices and social relationships between users 
as edges, complicated social networks can be mapped into large-
scale graphs, and quantum walks can be applied to explore and 
analyze user behavior and social trends [273], which helps with 
in-depth analysis of the structure and dynamics of social net-
works. For example, quantum walks have been shown to define 
specific centrality metrics in terms of node occupation on single-
layer and multilayer networks and to identify leaders in criminal 
networks [  276 ]. In addition to information networks and social 
networks, quantum-walk-based algorithms have been proposed 
to solve problems in other networks, including traffic networks 
[  277 ], unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications [ 21 ], 
and sensor networks [  278 ]. Specifically, a method for multiscale 
characteristic analysis for online car-hailing traffic volume with 
quantum walks was proposed, demonstrating the application 
of quantum walk algorithms in traffic optimization [277]. A 
coin-driven Hadamard quantum walk model [21] was proposed 
to identify the important edges of undirected complex networks 
and was deployed in a dynamic complex network involving a 
typical communication scenario found in UAV swarms to select 
important UAV nodes in a dynamic network.    
Conclusion and Outlook
   In this review, we have summarized the theories and charac-
teristics of quantum walks, introduced the progress of physical 
implementations of quantum walks, and described quantum-
walk-based algorithms and applications. Quantum walks repre -
sent a promising theoretical framework for application-specific 
quantum computing while holding the potential for universal 
quantum computing. The power of quantum walk computing 
systems over classical computers has been well demonstrated via 
the boson sampling task—as a particular multi-particle quantum 
walk sampling task. Moreover, with recent developments in the 
physical implementations of quantum walks, particularly in the 
integrated quantum photonics systems, important advances in 
both scale and programmability are demonstrated for quantum 
walk simulations and applications—most of which target prob-
lems of practical interest. This suggests that quantum walk models 
show a feasible path for building a practical and useful NISQ 
computer in the near future.
   Despite this rapid progress, some challenges remain in the 
realization of practical quantum walk computing systems. One 
major obstacle is to devise quantum walk algorithms. This 
requires further investigation of various quantum walk models and in-depth research of their characteristics, for example, to 
understand their roles in achieving quantum computational 
advantages. Another challenge is to continuously scale up the 
physical implementations of quantum walks while improving 
programmability. For example, in integrated quantum photon -
ics systems, the scale-up of quantum walks depends on both 
the number of evolving photons and the size of the Hamiltonian. 
Thus, increasing photon number becomes critical, and large-
scale but low-loss reconfigurable optical networks are also core 
requirements, together with high-efficiency photon detection. 
Furthermore, although quantum walks may not be used for 
targeting fault-tolerant quantum computing at the current 
stage, methods for implementing quantum walks with error 
correction or fault tolerance are necessary, considering that the 
potential large-scale quantum walks for practical interests would 
require simulations with high precision. To this end, it may be 
necessary to investigate error mitigation or error correction 
techniques in implementing quantum walks and also to explore 
quantum walk algorithms under noisy conditions. Although 
these challenges require continuous efforts to solve, the field of 
quantum walk computing is vigorously developing, and it paves 
the way to a foreseen future for quantum computing.

# Product Thesis

## Value proposition
Assyntrax reduces decisions in noise by gating action on regime and confidence. It is a filter for structure, not a promise of price prediction.

## How to sell
We reduce time spent operating in unstable regimes. The system tells when not to trust a signal and why.

## What the motor delivers
- State of the system (regime)
- Confidence score for structure
- Similarity to historical eras
- Explicit warnings and baselines

## Anti-deception block
- Always compare against naive baselines
- Always show metrics and failure modes
- Always show when the model is weak
